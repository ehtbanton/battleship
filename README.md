I am in the process of rewriting this code to be in a more modular and traditional format. 
For now, the files in SELF-CONTAINED SCRIPTS will work with no additional dependencies.

The second is my preliminary implementation of deep q-learning on the same game logic - though I believe there is a memory leak which I have not yet been able to find.
